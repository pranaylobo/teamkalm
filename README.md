# Problem


Eve Teasing, sexual harament, rape, domestic violence against womens are increasing day by day. 
The amount of violence against women have increased by many folds due to greater exposure in every field.
In order to curb the misconduct against women we have developed a system that can reduce crime against women.   

# Proposed Solution



An Android/iOS App for the Victim/Family
A website/app for Police and emergency services
Now when the victim sends an SOS the family,police and 
emergency services are alerted with exact location extracted from the GPS
Also a question will be asked what if the emergency services donâ€™t have the app/website,we also tweet the SOS message so that the
probability of help reaching increases
The victim/family/police can see each others location in realtime

# FEATURE EXPLANATION



SOS: Alert and send live location of the victim to family members, nearest police station and  corporator of that area.
Live tracking of victim as well as of police for the victim.
A tweet is automatically been published when SOS button is clicked with our hashtag #teamkalm so that we know when someone needs help. Also more relevant hashtags are used based on location such as #goregaon, #MumbaiPolice, etc. so that the help is reached to targeted audience via location.
Alerting nearby local businesses when SOS is clicked. 
The Back Camera starts recording the environment immediately
